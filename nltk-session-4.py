# Session 4: Getting the most out of what we've learned

# <markdowncell>
# So, now you know Python and NLTK! The main things we still have to do are:

# 1. Address some specific questions
# 2. Manage resources and results
# 3. Brainstorm some other uses for NLTK
# 4. Integrate IPython into your existing workflow
# 5. Have an open discussion about what we've done
# 6. Summarise and say goodbye!

# This lesson is pretty light on content and structure. Please do jump in at any point, and tell us about your research, and whether or not what you've learned here will be of much use.
