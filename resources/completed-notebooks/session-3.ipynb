    "The Fraser Speeches have been parsed for part of speech and grammatical structure by [*Stanford CoreNLP*](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml), a parser that can be loaded within NLTK. We rely on [*Tregex*](http://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/courses/ling289/Tregex.html) to interrogate the parse trees. Tregex allows very complex searching of parsed trees, in combination with [Java Regular Expressions](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html), which are very similar to the regexes we've been using thus far.\n",

    "If you plan to work more with parsed corpora later, it's definitely worthwhile to learn the Tregex syntax in detail. For now, though, we'll use simple queries, and explain the query construction syntax as we go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, we have to install Java, as some of our tools rely on some Java code. You'll very likely have Java installed on your local machine, but we need it on the cloud. To make it work, you should run the following line of code in the cloud Terminal:\n",
